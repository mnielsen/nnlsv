\section*{Introduction}

%
% the trouble with neural nets
%
Artificial neural networks are a powerful machine learning technique
which achieve excellent results for many pattern recognition problems
(e.g. KSH, Ng, Seide, Dahl, Schmidhuber, Bengio on Maxout).  But while
powerful, they can be difficult to train, and performance often
depends sensitively on the choice of hyper-parameters for the neural
network.  Picking these hyper-parameters can be an art-form, often
involving considerable trial and error based on hard-to-describe
heuristics. (XXX - It'd be nice to have refs). Casual users of neural
networks sometimes get poor results for a problem they expect to be
soluble by their network.  At that point, they face a conundrum: are
the poor results because of some easily-fixed issue with the
hyper-parameters, or is there some deeper obstacle?  Because of these
concerns some people advocate sticking with less finicky methods such
as support vector machines and random forests.

%
% what we do in this paper: broad picture
%
In this paper, we use clusters of graphics processing units (GPUs) to
train more than 100,000 neural nets.  This lets us systematically
explore hyper-parameter space, and to develop vivid visualizations and
animations showing how the network learns for different choices of
hyper-parameters.  From these visualizations we extract several
heuristic rules of thumb for choosing neural network hyper-parameters.

%
% the flavour
%
To convey the type of experiments we do and the results we obtain,
consider the following graph:
%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{plots/example.png}
\end{center}

%XXX --- sigmoid, 20 hidden unit, friction versus learning rate.
%Labels: hyper-parameter 1.  hyper-parameter 2.  Cost: nice gradient
%bar thing.  Title(ish): After training epoch 3.

Caption: Lower cost represents better performance.
%
What this graph shows is the performance of a single neural network
architecture on a particular image recognition task.  The important
thing is that performance is shown for a very large number of
different training configurations, all with the same architecture.  In
particular, the x and y axes are two important hyper-parameters for
the neural network (details to be explained later).  So we've trained
$40 \times 40 = 1,600$ neural nets, for $40$ different choices of
hyper-parameter $1$, and $40$ different choices of hyper-parameter
$2$.  The intensity of colour at the corresponding point on the graph
represents how well the neural network performs: dark is poor
performance, light is good performance.  By examining a judiciously
selected set of these graphs we will deduce heuristic rules for
choosing hyper-parameters.

%
% expanding on the type of results we get
%
The last paragraph describes our basic approach.  In fact, we will
obtain not just single graphs, but entire animations showing how
neural networks improve as they are trained.  This lets us see in a
vivid way how the networks improve for different choices of
hyper-parameters.  In this journal we cannot embed the animations
directly, but will instead show sequences of graphs.  This is nearly
as good as the animations to convey the results.  The Supporting
Information contains the full animations.  We also develop several
other similar video-based visualization techniques, but this example
already conveys the general flavour.

%
% The problem with the conventional approach to heuristics paragraph
%
There's a kind of folk wisdom of artificial neural networks --- a
collection of commonly-used heuristics that experts use to set
hyper-parameters.  Such heuristics have been collected in volumes such
as XXX (NNTOTD I, and II), as well as in many individual papers.
These heuristics have led to many successes, and often really do
improve neural network performance.

%
% What can go wrong as a result
%
However, while such heuristics can be useful, they are often based on
the investigation of a small number of networks.  The problem with
using such small-scale anecdotal evidence is that people may come to
believe heuristics that are misleading or even wrong.  A heuristic may
hold for some particular examples, but not in other circumstances.
One can see this in the large number of papers which introduce a new
technique, and provide evidence that technique is superior for some
class of problems, but then other users of neural nets do not find any
benefits to the technique, outside extremely similar circumstances.

%
% example of where we can _see_ what's going wrong
%
Another problem is that even a heuristic which is literally true may
have significant caveats.  For example, there has been much recent
interest in rectified linear units (ReLUs, XXX - cite), a type of
artificial neuron which appears to learn faster than other common
types of neuron, such as sigmoid and tanh units.  Our results confirm
that this is often the case, but, as we shall see, it is also often
much harder to find hyper-parameters so ReLUs learn quickly.  We are
able to provide a compelling visualization demonstrating this, and
also to precisely quantify how much harder it is to optimize with
ReLUs.

%
% how we approach this problem
%
In our approach we plot animations of two-dimensional slices of
hyper-parameter space.  This lets us explicitly see how different
combinations of hyper-parameters affect performance.  Done
judiciously, this gives us a more comprehensive viewpoint from which
to derive heuristics, and more robust conclusions than in the
conventional approach described above.  Of course, these 2-d slices do
not provide us with a comprehensive point of view, because other
hyper-parameters are being held fixed.  Furthermore, for any given
slice we cannot guarantee that any heuristics deduced will hold for
other choices of hyper-parameter.  However, we can build confidence by
plotting slices for several different choices of the other
hyper-parameters.  This visualization-based approach seems to be new
and complementary to prior work.

%
% complementary to Bayesian parameter optimization
%
In recent years there has been considerable focus on automated
procedures for finding hyper-parameters.  The simplest approaches are
box search (XXX cite) and variations.  More sophisticated methods are
now being developed, such as XXX, and Bayesian parameter optimization.
Encouraging recent results on Bayesian parameter optimization achieve
XXX.  However, to make Bayesian parameter optimization work well you
need good choices of prior distribution on the hyper-parameters.  The
results and approach we develop in this paper can help identify good
priors, and build confidence that a choice of priors is well motivated
(or, perhaps, should be modified).

%
% the curse of dimensionality: we're not claiming to escape it
%
Of course, our approach remains subject to the curse of
dimensionality.  Hyper-parameter space is high dimensional, and it's
inherently difficult to build up a comprehensive picture, even using
2-dimensional slices.  However, this statement of course also applies
to anyone trying to build up an understanding by hand-tuning single
hyper-parameters, trying to find just the ``right'' setting.  Our goal
is not to obtain a complete picture.  Instead, it's merely to develop
general (but partial) methods for understanding the structure of
hyper-parameter space.  It is a clear win to map out an entire 2-d
slice of hyper-parameter space at a fine-grained resolution, helping
us to better understand the relationships between those two
hyper-parameters.

% Results and Discussion can be combined.
\section*{Results and Discussion}

\subsection*{Experiments}

\subsubsection*{Learning rate versus momentum coefficient}

The learning algorithm we will use for our all experiments is
mini-batch stochastic gradient descent using momentum (XXX --- cite).
In our first set of experiments, described in this section, we
investigate learning as a function of two hyper-parameters: the
learning rate and the momentum coefficient.  Our experiments will lead
us to conjecture several heuristic relationships between these two
hyper-parameters.

Later sections will present similar experiments using other pairs of
hyper-parameters.  The next section gives a high-level overview of the
entire sequence of experiments, and discusses why different pairs of
hyper-parameters were chosen for investigation.  We could, of course,
have begun with that high-level overview.  However, since our
experiments are somewhat unusual in the neural networks literature, it
makes sense to start first with concrete results, since they will make
the high-level overview easier to understand.

Our experiments were performed using three neural network
architectures: a net with a single hidden layer containing 20 hidden
units; a net with a single hidden layer containing 40 hidden units;
and a net with two hidden layers, containing 40 and 20 hidden units,
respectively. All networks have an input layer with a neuron
corresponding to each pixel channel in the input image (the exact form
is dataset specific), and an output layer with a neuron for each
classification label (ten for all the datasets we use), followed by a
softmax layer.

The experiments made use of four separate activation functions: the
sigmoid (i.e., logistic), hyperbolic tangent (tanh), rectified linear
units (ReLU) XXX - citations, and softplus XXX - citations.  These
activation functions were applied throughout the network.

The experiments were performed using the MNIST XXX and CIFAR-10 XXX
training sets.  These are well-known labelled training sets used for
image recognition.  Training was performed using a negative
log-likelihood cost function.

The following graph shows the behaviour of 1,600 neural networks when
trained on the MNIST data for six epochs. These correspond to 40
choices of the learning rate and 40 choices of the momentum
coefficient, for a total of 1,600 = 40 $\times$ 40 networks.  Details
of the graph are explained below:
%
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{plots/detailed/LF-20R10R-20T10-MNIST-6.png}
%
% XXX --- This is currently a lie, we ony have 400 = 20 x 20.
%
% XXX - check: what do people actually do in terms of exploring momentum?
% Take a a look at four or five papers.
%
% XXX - ideally, learning rate labels should be in factors of 10.
%
% XXX - we want to comment on the power law.  Replot with log momentum?
%
% XXX - Range: 10**-4 to 1?  SOme other range?
To generate this graph we sampled 40 different values for the momentum
coefficient, ranging uniformly over 0.0 to 1.0.  This sampling process
reflects the way many researchers informally explore to find suitable
values for the momentum coefficient, often trying a number of values,
0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and then perhaps adjusting slightly once they've
found a good first approximation.

While we sampled uniformly for momentum, we instead sampled uniformly
on the logarithm of the learning rate.  This reflects the way many
researchers informally explore to find suitable values for the
learning rate, often trying a number of values, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and
so on.  A similar but more fine-grained approach is often used in
systematic grid searches.  We use a maximum value of 1.0 XXX for the
learning rate, since in all our MNIST experiments the nets did not
appear to be learning anything when the learning rate was that high.
We use a minimum value of 0.0001 XXX for the learning rate.  With
these choices our range for the learning rate includes most values
which have been used in prior literature.

A natural question is why we vary the learning rate while holding the
number of epochs constant.  Naively, this seems unnatural, since the
distance traversed by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm will
be proportional to the learning rate times the number of training
epochs.

However, in practice, with fixed computational resources, the number
of epochs we can train for is roughly a constant.  And so the question
that confronts someone looking to choose good hyper-parameters is how
to choose the learning rate which gives the best results after a fixed
number of epochs.

We choose 6 epochs in part because it was computationally feasible,
and in part because early experiments suggested that the graphs
obtained were changing only very slowly beyond the second epoch.  The
classification accuracies obtained after 6 epochs are comparable to
those obtained historically.  However, it should be noted that recent
research XXX suggests the value of going to very large numbers of
epochs ($XXX ~ 10^3$), and using an annealing schedule for learning
which ultimately results in very low learning rates.  We do not
investigate these possibilities here, although they suggest natural
questions for the future.

XXX - input structure

% XXX --- The following is an alternative answer to the above question
% We don't have the evidence to support that we're in this post-transient
% phase (although we suspect we are for most of the parameters plotted)
%
% Wouldn't it make more sense to vary the number of epochs so the
% product with the learning rate was a constant?  This argument is
% correct during an initial transient phase in which we're trying to
% get into the neighbourhood of a reasonable solution to the cost
% optimization problem.  But it's no longer correct when exploring the
% microstructure of the fitness landscape near that neighborhood.

% XXX --- Some interesting speculation here.  We haven't actually done it.
% 
% Why did we go for n epochs (where n is whatever it is?)  Combination
% of two answers: (1) Here's our evidence that we're near asymptoting
% --- to obtain this, do curve fitting to estimate what the long-run
% cost will be, assume that the cost after 3 epochs is given by $c_1 +
% c_2 * exp(c_3 t)$, where t is the time; (2) Computationally, that's as
% much as we could do.  Shoot for n = 5 or 6 or so.  Note that we need
% to validate the use of the exponential as an approximation for the
% long-run cost.  We ignore first 3 epochs due to possible transients.

Claim 1: Once you get into a pretty good regime, there are many more
good hyper-parameters (in the friction-log learning rate space) for
BReLUs than there are for other squashing functons.  

Claim 2: There is a consistent curve relating friction and learning
rate.  The curve is such that we see the learning is relatively
insensitive to the choice of friction.  For practical purposes,
setting friction at 0.2 is usually enough.  Note that it's only a
little better than non-momentum methods???

Claim 3: ReLU's best-case performance is better than tanh and sigmoid.
Our results on BReLU's suggest that RELu's are running into dead
neuron problems which can be avoided with BRELu's.  (ANother
possibility would be to consider SOftplus.  We have not done this,
but...)

Claim 4: Also note the order of the best-case performance for
nonlinearities.

Claim 5: ReLUs seem to have substantially more stochastic behaviour.
They provide good performance, but seem to be very sensitive to small
perturbations. Contrast with BReLU, sigmoid etc.  Sigmoid is much,
much smoother.  It's not just best-case which matters; how finicky the
activation function is matters a lot, too.  ReLUs surprisingly bad.
Want to be able to find relativley stable solutions that won't just
fall apart.  A miraculous ``super-good'' choice of parameters really
isn't that much use if noone else could ever have found it. SUre,
maybe it'd be great to ship in production --- but would you really
want to rely on this?  Magic, not science.  ``Then a miracle occurs''
school of machine learning.




CIFAR:

Note that the CIFAR results were only obtained for the net
architecture using 20 hidden units.

Q: Should we introduce some notion of local variance / local
dependence on variation of parameters?  Chris: Hold the initialization
and ordering of data constant, and try the 40 x 4 experiments for a
ReLU subexperiment --- do we see the same ``splotchiness''?

``For practical purposes, BReLU is likely to be a good choice.''
Caveats.

Momentum-based gradient descent isn't that interesting.  Cite the
Simard 2003 results, who also found this.








Setup / detailed comments about what we do: 

+ Details of what is done: The hyperparameters divide up into two types:

+ Learning parameters: friction (correct to momentum), learning rate.
AMount of training data (sort of).  Other choices: Mini-batch size;
use of momentum based SGD.  Choice of training set.

+ Architecural parameters: weight initialization, structure of the
layers.  Activation function.  Stuff that's fixed: Cost function;
softmax.

+ Why these choices of 2d section, i.e., why these particular pairs?
It's worth pointing out that there are many other possibilities, and
many that are clearly worth investigating.  Our choices in this
particular paper were largely motivated by anothr project, in which
these particular questions arose as a practical matter affecting our
choice of hyper-parameters --- eg., the learning rate / frition
tradeoff, etc.  We believe that thse hoices are likely to be of broad
interest, but much more could be done.  A thorough examination would
be enormous.  SO to extent this is arbitrary, but it was motivated by
practically arising concerns.  COmputational expense; readability is
the real issue.


+ SHould we do classification accuracy?  Cost?  SOmething else?
Should make it easy to generate data, so anyone who cares can easily
compare and contrast.  (This means is that to some extent it doesn't
matter if we make the wrong choice.)  We will do at least one example
where we do both cost and classification accuracy.  We choose to focus
on cost because fundamentally this is what the SGD agorithmi is trying
to minimize.  Hoever for practial purposes classification accuracy of
course matters, and issues such as overfitting --- further work would
need to be done to addess these.  Note: One should also do it for
different cost functions.







2. Initialization of weights.

Architecture: 20 HU.

Activation functions: ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, TODO BReLU.

Training data: CIFAR.

Results: 2 types of movie. 

Claim: sigmoid is almost insensitive to initialization.

Claim: ReLU cares a lot about init.  THe product of the SDs matters a
lot.  ANd it's stochastic.




3. Learning rate 1 versus learning rate 2.

Architecture: 20 HU, 40 HU, 40+20 HU (fixed learning rate in final
layer).

Activation functions: sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, BReLU.

Training data: CIFAR.

Claim: Best rates not on diagonal.


4. Number of HU (single layer) versus size of training data

Architecture: single layer, + softmax.

Activation: sigmoid.

Training data: MNIST.


CLaim: Surprising how little data, or how littl HU are required.




Results

+ ??? To talk about: low-dimensional ``optimal'' manifold in
hyperparameter space.  Bengio's ICML2011 for algorithms on tuning
hyperparameters.

+ Obviously 3d versions... hard to computationally.

(Note: In some sense, it's 2+1 dimension, because we're actually
looking over training time.  We do Not look to saturate, i.e., to
get to optimal performance.  So the results are more about how quickly
we're learning, not asymptotic capacity.  Add a caveat: in fact,
almost noone ever does this.  One of the lessons of recent work is
that there's much more benefit to going to long training times than
people previously thought, with a suitable schedule of annealing.)







Nonlearities we want: sigmoid.  Tanh.  ReLU.  BReLU.

Data sets: CIFAR.  MNIST.

Weight initialization: 1/sqrt n.  10 / sqrt n.

Bias: 0 and 1.

Architectures.  20 neurons. 40 neurons.  20+40 neurons.  For 40 and
20+40 neurons, CIFAR only, one weight initialization only.

Averaging: Don't do any averaging for experiments.

List of desirable properties for nonlinearities.  Discuss.  It's a
tentative list, but did lead to BReLUs.  It's a first cut, Softplus
also has many of these properties, it would be interesting to explore
more systematically.


+ Weight initization doesn't matter for sigmoids, but it does for ReLUs.

+ Sample the space of hyper-parameters, then try to learn the manifold
of optimal hyper-parameters.

+ Mini-batch size.

FUTURE POSSIBILITIES: CO might do a Nesterov experiment?  SoftPlus.

\subsection*{Bevelled Rectified Linear Units}

As part of our investigations we were led to introduce a new type of
activation function for an artificial neuron.  As seen above, this
activation function performed extremely well, and so it seems to be of
some independent interest to record here the heuristic considerations
which led to this activation function.

What's a good neural activation function look like?  Well,
heuristically you'd think it might ahve these properties: XXX.  Why
the conventional functions fail.  Recent work on ReLU in particular.
Potential shortcomings of ReLU.  We tried the following: BReLU.  As
we'll see below, we get surprisingly good results that seem to avoid
some of the problems with ReLU. (Mention Softplus with a citation).
Future work: XXX.  Of course, this isn't an actual argument, but it
does suggest that future investigations in this line may be
profitable.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

CHECK: PLoS One guidelines on conclusions.

OBSERVATION / RELATION TO PRIOR WORK: Over the past few years there's
been a lot of work using GPUs [refs] and cluster s[ refs] to train
neural networks.  Most of this work has focused on training larger and
deeper networks, for more epochs than before, to get superior
performance.  Our work demonstrates a dual strategy: instead of using
the increased comp power to train one or a few very large networks, we
use it to train very large numbers of relatively simple networks.  We
believe this dual strategy can be important to

+ LImit of the technique: These are only preliminary results.  Really
you want a much more comprehensive investigation.  It is even
possible, a priori, that there are no simple, esasily visualizable
rules of thumb to discover!  However, we believe it is worth at least
investigating the possibility, and our preliminary results suggest
that there is a surprisingly simple struture underlying regions of
hyperparameter space

+ Fun idea: AN atlas / periodic table of neural nets.  Would contain
lots of heuristics, and lots of failed heuristics that seem plausile
(but with disproofs).  Supprting evidence: lots and lots of videos.
Hundreds / thousands.

+ THe lower dimensional manifold: the parameters which are optimal in
hyperparameter space.


Glorot, Bngio et al: They found ReLU worked better than softplus in
deep networks.  How to reconcile with our results?
